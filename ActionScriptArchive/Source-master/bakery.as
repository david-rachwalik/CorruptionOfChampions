Delighted by your newfound vigor, the mass riding you lets a sound out halfway between a squeal and a moan, increasing the vehemence of her own ministrations.  You pull your hand free from its prison only to thrust it higher up, gripping the highly malleable breast of the buxom girl.  Increasing the intensity of your pelvic endeavor, you elicit another moan from the bodacious vixen's lips, only adding fuel to your frenzied motions.

Still remembering your goal, you bring your hand down and find a harder globule of chocolate that must be her clitoris.  While passively administering jabs into her pussy, you concentrate your fingers on her love button, rubbing with both tenderness and vigor.  Moaning openly now, the girl lets out a keening wail that puts you dangerously close to the edge yourself.
