# [Corruption-of-Champions-HTML](https://github.com/Kitteh6660/Corruption-of-Champions-HTML "HTML port of CoC")
The HTML port of CoC, original game by Fenoxo.

This project demonstrates how CoC can be ported entirely over to HTML. The major advantage is that plugins won't be required and it will work on mobile devices.

That's right! No more compiling CoC APK that might never even work on most Android devices. I won't even have to compile IPA file for iOS as well!
