## How to Contribute

Okay first of all, coding should be relatively straightforward if you know how to code in JavaScript.

Here are the list of DOs and DON'Ts. Legacy flags will be phased out in favour for the new flag system that's infinitely expandable, even beyond 3000 flags.

**DO:**

* Make use of the new code.
* Try to refrain from adding new code that relies on old flags.

**DON'T:**

* Track older NPCs using status effects. Instead, use the flags. The older NPCs will use the new flags.
* Make too many content in one pull request. Try to focus on one specific content. You may add dependent content too.
* Use copy and paste code that would make the code messier.
* Use deprecated functions like choices() and simpleChoices(). Use addButton instead.
